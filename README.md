# Reddit Minimal

The project is using [Reddit JSON Api](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON) to get the data from Reddit

The project was a task given by Codecademy being a part of their full-stack engineer course path. The task was to build an application for Reddit. The goal of the project was to showcase all previews skills and technologies learned until this point on the path (HTML / CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Git and Github Projects, Command line, Wireframes)
